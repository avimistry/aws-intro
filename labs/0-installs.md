# Lab 0: Installs or Flight Checklist

# Task

Download slides, labs and code, make sure yoyu have access to an AWS account and Node v6+ and npm v3+.

# Walk-Through

If you would like to attempt the task, then skip the walk-through and go for the task directly. However, if you need a little bit more hand holding or you would like to look up some of the commands or code or settings, then follow the walk-through.

## Slides&code

Repo: <https://github.com/azat-co/aws-intro>

Git clone (you can fork first too):

```
git clone https://github.com/azat-co/aws-intro.git
```

Download with CURL and unzip (create a new folder):

```
curl  https://codeload.github.com/azat-co/aws-intro/zip/master | tar -xv
```

## AWS Account

If you don't have an account, sign up for free tier: <https://aws.amazon.com/free>.

Once you have an account, make sure you can access the web console and EC2 dashboard (click on EC2 from the home page).

## Node and npm Installations

Simply go to <https://nodejs.org>, find version 6 (or 8 - LTS which is long-term support) and download it. npm comes with Nodeâ€”no extra needed.


Check versions:

```
node --version
npm --version
```

## Good to have tools

* [Git](https://git-scm.com) mostly for code deploys and Elastic Beanstalk
* Code editor [Atom](https://atom.io) or [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [CURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) and [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org) (for Windows)
